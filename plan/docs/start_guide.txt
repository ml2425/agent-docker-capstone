## Project Documeents
Your app requires the LLM to use three categories of documents:

A. Project Purpose & Implementation Intent
1. objectives.md

Explains the full purpose of the app: to generate verifiable medical MCQs, enforce provenance, and use an agentic pipeline.


2. objectives_extra.txt

Contains implementation details for:

Triplet editing behaviour

Curation rules

Distractor strategy (“plausible but incorrect swaps”)

Visual Kernel → OVP → Human approval


LLM instruction:
 Use these documents to guide behaviour, validation rules, and interaction patterns.

B. Agent Framework + Coding Patterns
3. framework.txt

Lists the agentic building blocks allowed:

LLM Agents

Parallel / Sequential Agents

Loop Agents

Tools (MCP, Custom, Built-in)

Memory, sessions, compaction


4. agent_examples.txt

Contains Python examples using the Ask Framework, including:

Agent powered by an LLM

Sequential agents

Parallel agents

Loop agents

MCP tools

Custom tools

Memory/state examples


LLM instruction:
 Select ANY 4 features from framework.txt.
Examples from agent_examples.txt MUST be used as templates when writing code.

C. Medical Schema for MCQ Generation
5. schema.md

Defines the medical entity types and relations for triplets and MCQ correctness:
Examples:

SYMPTOM → SUGGESTS → DISORDER

MICROBE → CAUSES → DISORDER

DISORDER → INDICATES → INVESTIGATION/PROCEDURE


6. schema_examples.md

Shows concrete examples of MCQs built using the schema, with:

Vignettes

Correct triplets

Distractors

Valid entity paths

LLM instruction:
 ALL triplets, MCQs, distractors, and Visual Triplets must follow this schema

 
## How to use documents
 Below is the explicit workflow the LLM MUST follow when implementing the system.

STEP 0 — Read all documents and build internal mental model

Before writing any code, the LLM must understand:

Project aim → from objectives.md

Behavioural rules → from objectives_extra.txt

Permitted architectural patterns → from framework.txt

Coding templates → from agent_examples.txt

Knowledge schema → from schema.md

Correct MCQ construction → from schema_examples.md

STEP 1 — Choose the architectural components

The LLM must select 4 features from framework.txt.
Valid examples include:

Sequential Agents

Loop Agents

Custom Tools

Session Memory

Context compaction

MCP tools

Use examples in agent_examples.txt as implementation templates.

STEP 2 — Implement the Agentic Pipeline

Pipeline is defined in detail in objectives.md.
The required agents are:

Source Ingestion Agent

Fact Extraction Agent

KB Management Agent

MCQ Generation Agent

Visual Refiner Agent

Human-in-the-loop verifier (approval gate)

Each agent uses Ask Framework patterns (sequential, loop, or tool-augmented) consistent with framework.txt.

STEP 3 — Enforce Triplet Curation Behaviour

Rules MUST follow objectives_extra.txt:

Subject/action/object must match the allowed format

Human can edit triplets only at review time

No vague terms

Example inputs MUST follow the good/bad examples table

The LLM must build:

A validator

A UI schema for editing

The data structure for storing approved triplets

STEP 4 — MCQ Generation Must Follow Schema

MCQs must follow logical paths defined in:

schema.md

schema_examples.md

MCQ rules:

Use a C-TRIPLET as the correct answer

Distractors must follow the “plausible but incorrect swap” rules

All options must be medically plausible

Each MCQ must include provenance

STEP 5 — Visual Kernel → OVP Pipeline

As defined in objectives_extra.txt:

MCQ agent generates a Visual Kernel Draft (VKD).

Visual Refiner Agent produces:

OVP (Optimized Visual Prompt)

Visual Triplet

Human approves or edits.

Only on explicit request is the image generated.

STEP 6 — Build the Python Codebase in Cursor

Cursor should output files in:

/app
  /agents
  /tools
  /services
  /db
  /ui
/docs
tests/


LLM should write modular Python using:

Google Ask Framework

Pydantic

SQLite

Simple JSON storage for KB

Chainlit front-end if applicable
